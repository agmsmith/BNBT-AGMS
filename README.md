# BNBT-AGMS
This is a fixed up version of the BNBT BitTorrent Tracker to get it to run on current day computers, which have larger numbers (32 or 64 bits) and newer code libraries.

A Tracker is a dual purpose server-side program that lists available torrents for download on a web page, and lets client programs find other client programs for file sharing.

I've started with the code from BNBT 8.5 as of July 2006, as found on https://sourceforge.net/projects/bnbtusermods/files/BNBT85/July%202006%20Critical%20Update/ in 20060727-bnbt85-src.zip  The documentation and sample files (without the precompiled executables) are from bnbt81b-3-sf.zip, a slightly earlier version.

I'm trying to get the basic BNBT to compile under Fedora 28 Linux, a circa 2018 version of the GNU/Linux operating system.  There's an option for a MySQL database version of BNBT, which I'm ignoring, so that likely won't build.
